# Computer Aided Design & Digital Fabrication
## Objectives
Participants will learn digital fabrication technologies such as 3D Printing &Laser Cutting, how to use CAD Software to create 2D and 3D models, which they can fabricate as functional prototypes.

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
- Perform 2D and 3D Computer Aided Designs using CAD Software
- Explain the principles of Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing
- Operate 3D Printers and customise jobs for 3D Printing
- Operate Laser Cutters and configure jobs for Laser Cutting &engraving
- Design and fabricate a functional prototype using 3D Printer and Laser Cutter
